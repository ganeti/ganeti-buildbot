This hosts slack (https://code.google.com/p/slack/) roles for the
Ganeti external buildbot hosts.

Where do the files come from?

- .bashrc files are copies from a live Debian installation
- files in
  ./roles/buildmaster/files/srv/buildbot/masters/ganeti/public_html
  are, except for favicon.ico (which is Ganeti specific) taken from a
  live Buildbot installation (Buildbot itself is also GPL v2, but
  noting this down for reference).
- parts of master.cfg were taken out of the sample buildbot
  configuration file.
- the other files are Google-authored, and the GPL v2 license applies
  to them, as noted in the headers
